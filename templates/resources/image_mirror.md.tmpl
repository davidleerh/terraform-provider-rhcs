# rhcs_image_mirror (Resource)

**Important**: Image mirrors are only supported for IDMS (ImageDigestMirrorSet) through ICSP (ImageContentSourcePolicy) configuration. This resource configures registry overrides that work with HyperShift's IDMS/ICSP detection mechanism.

For detailed information on setting up IDMS/ICSP for management clusters, see: [IDMS/ICSP for Management Clusters](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/how-to/disconnected/idms-icsp-for-management-clusters/)

For comprehensive usage guides and examples, see:
- [Image Mirrors Guide](https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs/blob/main/docs/guides/image-mirrors.md)
- [Image Mirrors Examples](https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs/tree/main/examples/image_mirrors)
